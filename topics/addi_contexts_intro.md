ADDI Contexts
=============

The ADDI data model revolves around the concept of a context.

An ADDI context represents a set of describable and addressable
things.  These things could be abstract or concrete, digital or
physical.

Sometimes these sets can represent a single individual, but what
they actually represent is a set with a maximum of one member.
